## Monetary Policy Targets

- [[Nominal & Real Interest Rate| Interest Rate]]
	Interest Rate ++ => [[Money]] Demanded --
	When Interest Rate ++ => Alternatives for holding money ( Treasury Bills )

We can move along the MDC via change in Interest rate or Quantity of Money Demanded.

Anything other than change in Interest rate will shift the MDC
```ad-info
Usually increases, such as [[GDP]] or [[Correlation between Price Level & AE|Price Level]] will result in a right shift, and vise verca.

For example, if more transactions are taking place (higher real GDP) or more money is needed for each transaction (higher price level), the demand for money will be higher

When the [[Federal Reserves ( FED )]] increases the [[Money Supply]], [[Households]] and [[Firms]] tends to use their in hand money and use less of them for investment. So banks have to reduce the interest rates to encourge people to get loans.

In reverse, less money -> more valued money -> spend more -> borrow more -> inrease interest rate.
