# How Banks Create Money
When someone donates $1000 to the bank bank uses 90% of this money to lend to someone.

This $900 is used by someone else to deposit it to another bank, and %90 of that money is also lend to another one.

$810 is lend to someone else and this cycle continues.

In theory, we can assume that the money is infinitely divisible and there is infinitely many bank. So at the end;
$$
\$1000 + \$900 + \$810 + \$729 \cdots = \$10000
$$

So with a %10 of [[Required Reserves Ratio]], we get 10 times amount of money we started.

This multiplicator is called [[Simple Deposit Multiplier]]. In reality with a %10 [[Required Reserves Ratio]] we are estimated to get a maximum of 2.5 [[Simple Deposit Multiplier]].
