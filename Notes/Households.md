### Household Production
Childcare, cleaning and cooking if it is done by members of the house it is not paid but if it is done by some other person, they will get paid and it will count to the [[GDP]].

Increase in the women entering the workforce, replaces household production by paid childcare and restaurant meals. So [[GDP]] will increase overall.
