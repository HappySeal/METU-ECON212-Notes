# Aggregate Demand ( AD ) Curve
Demand++ => Production++ & Product Prices++

Out [[Aggregate Expenditure Model]] focuses on the first element of this equation(Production) but what about **product prices**.

**In larger Economies**:
[[Aggregate Expenditure Model#^bb1584|Aggregate Expenditures]]++ $\propto$ Price Level++
^1

But does the increase in Price Level also increase the [[Aggregate Demand Curve#^1|Aggregate Expenditures]] ?
In general it does.

Price Level++ => AE-- => Price Level-- => AE++ => ...

[[Monetary Policy]]'ies with expansionary monetary policy shifts AD curve to the **right**,
contractionary monetary policies shifts to **left**.

If [[GDP]] is in inverse relationship with the price levels.

This relation is called **aggregate demand curve**
