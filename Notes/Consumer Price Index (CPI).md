To calculate the CPI we need;
- A basket of goods.
- The cost of that basket of goods in a base year.
- The prices in the current year

$$
\text{CPI}_\text{current year} = \frac{\text{Cost of Basket}_\text{This year}}{\text{Cost of Basket}_\text{Base year}}*100
$$

Sometime called as **cost of living index**

Even if **CPI** is the most widely used tool to measure to inflation it has some biasses
