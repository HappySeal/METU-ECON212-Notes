Since *Fixed Capital Consumption* is relatively low compared to the [[GDP]] we can assume about [[Other Measures for Total Income#National Income|National Income]] that 
$$
GDP \approx NI \; \text{since} \; \text{Fixed Capital Consumption} \lt\lt GDP $$
For [[Other Measures for Total Income#Disposable Income|Disposable Income]] we can write $NI$ as

$$
\text{Disposable Income} = \text{National Income} - \text{Net Taxes}
$$
$$
\text{Disposable Income} + \text{Net Taxes} = GDP = \text{National Income}
$$
If we **assume** [[Other Measures for Total Income#Net Taxes|Net Taxes]] does not change as $NI$ does, we can conclude that any change in [[Other Measures for Total Income#Disposable Income|Disposable Income]] will be realted with the [[GDP]]. So we can make correlation between [[Consumption]] and [[GDP]].

Furthermore we can divide $\text{Disposable Income}$ into consumptions and savings. The new formula for $NI$ will look like
$$
\text{National Income} = \text{Consumption} + \text{Savings} + \text{Taxes}
$$
$$
Y = C + S + T
$$
Any change in $NI$ will be equal to 
$$
\Delta Y = \Delta C + \Delta S + \Delta T
$$
We assumed that [[Other Measures for Total Income#Net Taxes|Net Taxes]] is equal to $0$ so:
$$
\Delta Y = \Delta C + \Delta S
$$
Divide both sides by $\Delta Y$ gives us

$$
\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta Y} = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y} + \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}
$$
$\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}$ is known as the **Marginal propensity to save**. At the end this equation will be equal to
