# Monetary Policy in Post Financial Crisis

First move of [[Federal Reserves ( FED )|FED]] in such situation will be winding down its lender-of-last-resort loans (Loans that banks took as a final destination to lend money).

Unless if economy is not in a deep recesion.

Otherwise if the main problem is caused by structural stagination problem, solve them rather than doing expansionary monetary policies.

With such policital movemend done by FED 

- Inflation remained lower than desired. 

- Economic growth remained sluggish. During the upturn, growth was only 2 to 3 percent rather than the 5 to 6 percent they were hoping for. 

- There was a fear that ending the expansionary policy would throw the economy into a recession and possibly even another financial crisis.
