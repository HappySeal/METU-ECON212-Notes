# Unemployment Rate

Total number of civilians which are [[unemployed]] over the labor force ^f0bc2c

$$\dfrac{\text{Number of Unemployed}}{\text{Total Labor Force}}$$

```ad-info
title: Another way to measure Unemployment is that
Total unemployed, plus discouraged workers,plus all other marginally attached workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers
```


But this measure is not *perfect* ! 
Why??

> It may **understate** the employment
> - unemployed and not in labor force req. judgement.
> - does not measure intensity of employment (Full-time vs Part-time???)

> It may **overstate** the employment
> - people might be denote themselves as looking but not (for still getting unemployment wage)
> - might be claiming unemployed to evade tax
