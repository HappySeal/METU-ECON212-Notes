# Distributional Costs of Inflation
unexpected inflation redistributes income from lenders(money givers) to borrowers(money takes)

```ad-info
If lenders charge a nominal 5% and expected inflation to 2%, real rate is 3%

But if inflation is 4%, real rate is only %1 or even less depending on the inflation rate
