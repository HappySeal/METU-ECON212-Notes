## Calculating GDP
There are four major components of GDP
- Personal consumption expenditures, of [[Consumption|Consumption (C)]]
- Gross private domestic invested, of [[Investment|Investment (I)]]
- Government consumptions and gross invesment, or [[Government Purchases|Government Purchases(G)]]
- Net exports of G&S, or [[Net Exports|Net Exports (NX)]]

So GDP can be expressed as 
$$
GDP = C \; + \; I \; + \; G \; + \; NX
