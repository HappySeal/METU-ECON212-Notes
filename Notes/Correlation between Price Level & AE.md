# Correlation between Price Level & AE
Price level and AE related in three ways
- Price levels++ => Real Value of [[Households]]' wealth
- Price levels++ => Exports-- & Imports++ = [[Net Exports|NX]]--
- Price levels++ => [[Households]] and [[Firms]] need more money to buy/sell => Interest Rate++ => Investment Spending--
	(i.e Higher price means more money needed to buy/sell so demand for loans increases, this increases the interest rate and eventually spendings on investment decreases)

#### Price level is proportional to AE & Real [[GDP]]
