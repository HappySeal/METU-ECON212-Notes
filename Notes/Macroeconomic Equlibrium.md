# Macroeconimic Equlibrium
When [[Aggregate Expenditure Model#^9700BB|Aggregate Expenditures]] is equal to the [[GDP]] in an economy, equlibrium will be reached.

That means all of the product that produced is sold and no other G&S is left in inv.

If.. | then... | and...
---|---|---
AE = GDP | $\Delta Inv$ = 0 | Economy is in eq.
AE < GDP | $\Delta Inv$ > 0 | GDP & Employment dec.
AE > GDP | $\Delta Inv < 0| GDP & Employment inc.


## Graphing Macroeconomic Equlibrium
- We draw an 45$\degree$  line and and plot **produced** quantity on x axis and **sold** quantity on y axis
- If:
	- **Produced** > **Sold** := Lower production
	- **Sold** > **Produced** := Increase production
	- **Sold** = **Produced** := At Equilibrium

![[Example Graph of Macroeconomic Equlibrium]]

- Same thing could be applied to the **NI** vs **AE**
- **NI** is equal to C + I +G +NX
- If we consider C as a var. We can apply 45$\degree$ diagram to the [[Consumption]]

If there is no other expenditures we can say that, the point that **C** crosses **AE** is equal to the Macroeconomic Equlibrium. But there is...
After stacking all of the other expenditures we get.

But **I,G and NX** are considered constant throught the years therefore our **C** line is just shifted up.
The point where **C + I + G + NX** crosses **AE** is the MacroEq.
