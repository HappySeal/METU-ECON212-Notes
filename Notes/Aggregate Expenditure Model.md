#Main 
# Aggregate Expenditure Model
Focuses on **shot-run relationships** between total spending and [[GDP]], assuming the **price level is constant**


>  **Main Consept** 
> $$
\text{GPD}_\text{In spesific year} \; \propto \; \text{Level of Aggregate Expenditure}
 $$

Four components of [[GDP]]( [[Consumption]], [[Investment]], [[Government Purchases]], [[Net Exports]]) is still relevant with a slight twist

##### Planned Invesment
Instead of [[Investment]] we use planned investments in our equation. Only difference is that [[Investment#^5bdc0f|hold inventorites]] is not accodimated for planned investment.

$$
\text{Planned Inv(PI)} = \text{I} - \Delta \text{Inv}
$$

## Aggregate Expenditures
^9700bb
total spending in the economy.

$$
AE = GPD = C + PI + G + NX
