# Consumption in AE
- **Affected by**
	- Current [[Other Measures for Total Income#^791e00|Disposable Income]] $\propto$ k
	
	- [[Households]] Wealth $\propto$ k
	
	- Expected Future Income $\propto$ k
	
	- The Price Level $\propto$ $\frac{1}{k}$
	
	- The [[Nominal & Real Interest Rate|Interest Rate]] $\propto$ $\frac{1}{k}$
		Higher Interest rates will encourage people to save rather than spend

#### **Marginal Propensity of Consume (MPC) 
#### $$
MPC = \frac{\Delta \text{Consumption}}{\Delta \text{Disposable Income}} = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta YD}$$
- A.K.A **slope** of consumption function


In order to explain changes in [[GDP]] we have to first make a correlation between [[Consumption|Consumption (C)]] and [[GDP]].

#### Formulation
![[Correlation between C & NI]]

$$
1 = MPC + MPS
$$
In each economy, some of percentage of the income will be spent and some will be saved.
