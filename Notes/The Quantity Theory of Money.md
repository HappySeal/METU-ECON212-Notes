# The Quantity Theory of Money
Number of Money $\propto$ Price Level
$$
M \times V = P \times Y
$$
$M$ = [[Money Supply]]
$V$ = **Velocity of the money.** the average number of times each dollar in the [[Money Supply|MS]] is used to purchase goods and services included in [[GDP]].
$P$ = [[Nominal Prices|Price Level]]
$Y$ = Real Output ([[Real GDP]])


But can we always calculate $V$?? Yes but it is not same in all occasions. **The Quantity Theory of Money** assumes $V$ as constant and explains connection between [[Money Supply]] and Prices.

So also this funtion generates
$$
\Delta M + \Delta V = \Delta P + \Delta Y
$$
$\Delta M$ = Growth rate of [[Money Supply]]
$\Delta V$ = 0
$\Delta P$ = Growth rate of Price Leves (a.k.a [[Inflation]])
$\Delta Y$ = Growth rate of real output

By rearranging we can find [[Inflation]] as
$$
\Delta P = \Delta M - \Delta Y
$$
By that we can say that
- $\Delta M \gt \Delta Y$ => Inflation
- $\Delta M \lt \Delta Y$ => Deflation
- $\Delta M = \Delta Y$ => Neither
