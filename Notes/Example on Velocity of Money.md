# Example on Velocity of Money
Measuring: 
• The money supply (M) with M1, 
• The price level (P) with the GDP deflator, and 
• The level of real output (Y) with real GDP, 

We obtain the following value for velocity (V) for 2012: 
$$
V = \frac{1.05 \times \$15.471T}{$2.309T} = 7.0
$$
This result tells us that , during 2012 each dollar of M1 was on avarage spent seven times on G&S included in GDP.
