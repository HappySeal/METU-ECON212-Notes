```ad-note

In 2008, the world financial system nearly stopped working. • Banks were on the verge of collapse. • The stock market dropped precipitously. • The U.S. economy fell into a serious recession. Central banks and governments across the world took extraordinary steps to try and calm the crisis. A highly unconventional monetary policy became the new normal.
