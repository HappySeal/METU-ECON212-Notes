# Deficit
Shortfall of revenues under payments.

Flow measure, defined for a period of time

In the short-run, if economy is below the potential, deficits are good because it increases the expenditures and moves output ([[GDP]]) to closer to potential

If governments expenditures is greater than the revenue of country, it sells bonds to private individuals and to the centeral bank.

Bonds are promises to pay back the money in the future.

Centeral bank can print inf amount of money to buy bonds but doing such will cause serious [[Inflation]] problems.
