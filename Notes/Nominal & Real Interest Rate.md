If you lend money, you would naturally want to get an interest back.

But if you deposit $1000 and recieve $1060, is it equal to the gaining $60 in 1990's???

That 6% is called **Nominal Interest Rate**

We can adjust it by subtracting the current [[Inflation]] rate from the **Nominal Interest Rate**.

So if price of everything rise by 2% and your nominal interest is 6%, your **Real Interest Rate** will be equal to 4%

In this figure, by just looking at the Nominal interest rate we can think that in 1980's interest rate is huge compared to the forecoming years. But if we adjus it according to the inflation rate we can see that the **real interest rate** is actually below negative. This is a indicator of how **nominal interest rate** could be deceptive.
