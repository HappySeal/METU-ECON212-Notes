# Guaranteed-Job Proposal
```ad-note
With a guaranteed-jobs program, the government provides a minimum job for every eligible citizen who truly want to work and cannot find a job, and primarily benefits the least well off. There is a reason most existing government programs are designed differentlyâ€”to help the middle class in addition to the least well off. Much of the current debate about unemployment is not about providing a minimum job; rather it is about providing people with a level of job that they expect

```ad-summary
TLDR; Guaranteed jobs good for unemployment, bad for government due to cost.
